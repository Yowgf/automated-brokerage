Notes on our data table

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Continuing the discussion of our data table, I would like to note
that some attributes have been rationalized. An example is the
attribute "floors", which is the number of floor levels in a house.

Just as a side note, I stopped using Lemonade. I won't go through
that much pain for nothing...

I decided to remove the columns ["id", "date", "lat", "long",
"zipcode"]. These don't add value to the kind of analysis we plan to
do, which is supposed to cluster the data into exactly 5 clusters,
which in turn will be given to the real estate agent to make a
heuristic categorization of which kinds of houses we have.

Partially checked the validity of all the values

Plan to:
  Finish values validity checking
  Transform "bathrooms" and "floors" into integers
  Discretize everything.
