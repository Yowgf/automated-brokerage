Notes on our data table

--------------------------------------------------------------------

So, as mentioned on yesterday's notes, I have created a serious
suspicion of my current data table. But after a closer look, today,
it seems pretty ok. I am also taking into account the principle of
accepting uncertainty for timely results, because the origin of the
dataset is not so important in this case, and its vast usage acts as
a kind of substitute validator.

The following steps include:

- verify which attributes are relevant to our analysis
- make sense of each of them
- check if there are missing attributes
- check if lemonade is correctly infering their types
- format things like the date, for better visualization
- check if we should stay with the same format of "broken" numbers,
  for example of bathrooms
