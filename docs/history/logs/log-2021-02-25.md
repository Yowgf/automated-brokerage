Notes on MD-TP2 project

--------------------------------------------------------------------

So, I decided to come back to strictly using CRISP-DM as a guide,
starting on phase 2: "Data Understanding".

The task 2.1 "Collect initial data" underlines what is essentially
the data loading process. I have already done that, but have not
noted down the steps I took, as recommended. So, I do that in the
file "cdm-21.txt".

The task 2.2 essentially recommends describing the data in the "data
description report". That is recorded in the file "cdm-22.txt".

The task 2.3 is the data exploration task. It asks you to explore
the data, plot graphs, relate interesting attributes, analyse key
attributes distributions. There is an output mainly related to
visualization. That is done in the notebook "notebook/cdm-23". The
outputs are stored in the folder "doc/history/cdm-23".
