Today I finished the algorithm for computing the gap statistic,
which marks the end of every pre-processing thing I wanted to do,
which were:

- Drop useless columns.
- Check the data column by column to see if there is anything wrong
  (missing attributes, logical error within or between features)
- Perform normalization
- Check the null hypothesis on the natural clusterability of the
  data by the gap statistic approach.
  
Just wanted to note down a word: KPI (key performance indicator).
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Anyway, what I want to do know is to fit a clustering model through
the data. The obvious challenge then is to select the right
one. What are the objective measures to be used to select or reject
a certain model? What is the theoretical basis that supports its
use? When was it first created, can I cite a paper :D?
