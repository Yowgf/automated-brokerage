Notes on findings. MD-TP2 data mining project

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Just on the task of setting up Lemonade for the Housing Prices data, I
  found out that this dataset is not actually the famous Boston
  Housing dataset. That Boston one was first used on the paper
  "Hedonic housing prices and the demand for clean air", and had 506
  instances of 13 attributes.
Our dataset, on the other hand, has 21613 lines, and 21 features. I
  am having a hard time finding the source of our data.

The dataset as is was inserted onto the md.lemonade.org website. It
  remains necessary to perform manual selection of features related
  to the current project, which will probably my next step.
